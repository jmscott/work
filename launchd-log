#/bin/bash
#
#  Synopsis:
#	Trivial script to help launchd set up configs and proper logging.
#  Usage:
#	cd /usr/local/blobio
#	
#	#  source in optional config script
#	echo 'ulimit -n 2048' >>etc/launch-log.conf
#
#	launchd-log bin/flowd server etc/blobio.flow
#
#  Exit Status:
#	*	exit status of launched process
#  	127	unexpected error in launchd-log
#  Note:
#	Why put launched-log in $JMSCOTT_ROOT/sbin?
#	Seems like /bin/ better for permissons, since typically /sbin/
#	is only owned by a particular user.
#
#	Consider renaming script to launchd-helper.
